## GarageTrac

GarageTrac is an application that uses the Edmund's API to allow a user to select a vehicle year, make and model to display that vehicle's suggested maintenance schedule. 

This project uses technologies I learned in my Front-End course at NSS: AngularJS, Firebase, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5 and CSS.
